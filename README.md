HW #7 TrainScheduler

In this assignment, we were asked to create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The application should retrieve and manipulate information using Moment.js. The completed page provides up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

Requirements:

* When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
    * Train Name
    * Destination
    * First Train Time -- in military time
    * Frequency -- in minutes
    * Code this app to calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time.
    * Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.
